<p>
  Hi there!<br />
  This is my tech blog, where I document all the things I do in my small but mighty homelab.<br />
  I'm a Linux, Virtualization and IaC enthusiast who wants to work with these technologies professionally as well as privately.<br />
  I have a big love of learning in these areas and am very curious, and hope to share that passion.
  If you're interested in following my journey, you can also follow my <a href_"https://www.instagram.com/lilymightbyte" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, where I post tech info posts and share pictures of my homelab!

  My homelab currently consists of two Raspberry Pis ('CutiePi' and my OpenMediaVault NAS), my Laptop with an Arch Linux Installation, my PC that dualboots OpenSuse Tumbleweed and Windows, an Arduino and a Netgear Managed 8-port switch. It is ever growing, so this is an ideal place to follow the journey and see how I did things and what I learned in the process!
