# About
<p>
  Hello and welcome to my tech blog!<br />
   My name is Lily Sabath and this is where I document all the things I do in my homelab.<br />
  I have a passion for old hardware and SBCs, Linux operating systems, and virtualization technologies.<br />
  I love learning about IT and I love sharing that passion.

  My homelab is always growing, so this is an ideal place to follow the journey and see how I did things and what I learned in the process!
