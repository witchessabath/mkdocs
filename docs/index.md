# About
<p>
  Hi there!<br />
  This is my tech blog, where I document all the things I do in my homelab.<br />
  I have a passion for old hardware and SBCs, Linux operating systems, and virtualization and IaC technologies.<br />
  I love learning in these areas and am very curious, and hope to share that passion.
  If you're interested in following my journey, you can also follow my <a href_="https://instagram.com/lilymightbyte" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, where I post tech info posts and share pictures of my homelab!
  My homelab is always growing, so this is an ideal place to follow the journey and see how I did things and what I learned in the process!
